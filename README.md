***STA-145-Final-Project***

For my final project, I ask the question, "Is there a realtionship between gender of the artist and song explictness?". I've gathered data on this question by using the Top 200 Songs of the 2010's provided by Pitchfork, a music blog/site. 
***Instructions***
To access the script, open the "guarraa-final_project.R" file which contains the code for my project. 
***Data***
The data collected for this project was found on Pitchfork.com, a music blog/website. The main goal of my project is to measure the relationship between gender and song explicitness. I selected the music catergory as it is something I am interested and I will forever stay true to my belief that the 2010's is when music reached its peak.
***Operationalization***
In order to retrieve the data used to asses whether or not there is a correlation between gender of the artist and song explicitness, my team and I created a codebook that covered all possible outcomes for the two qualitative variables used in this question. 
Gender was measured in 3 values, woman=1, man=2, mix/band=3
Explicitness was measured in 3 values, explicit=1, clean=2, 3=both
For my R-script, I soley utilized the first two values of the "explicit" variable.
